List of Bugs to Fix:


- Progress bar for reading completion.

- Add pause to nav bar when paused, along with other notifications of reader.

- Spacebar/arrow before rendering -> error.

- Settings page non existant.

- Click on "Speed Read It!", afterwords, focus is on that bar and spacebar will "click" that, not pausing correctly.

- Alter pause length based on word length?

- Changing WPM during render via slider has no effect until pause/unpause.

- Need to auto blur to prevent re space to button.

- Stats don't update until page refresh.

- Collapse order - reader should be last.
