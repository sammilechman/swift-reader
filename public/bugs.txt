List of Bugs to Fix:

- Switching between Rails pages and Backbone pages. From the Create Account page (a Rails page), clicking on Contact (a Backbone page) results in the url "http://localhost:3000/users/new#/contact", but it should result in "http://localhost:3000/#/contact".

- Can't alter WPM during diplay, pause, etc.

- No way to track user statistics.

- 99% html problem - don't want a scroll bar, this solves the default spacebar operation of scrolling down. (space for pause)

- Slider bugs: Incorrectly syncs when typing in the box, but fixes when you tab back into the view. Doesn't sync dynamically.

- Progress bar for reading completion.

- Add pause to nav bar when paused, along with other notifications of reader.

- Spacebar before rendering -> error.
