List of Bugs to Fix:

- Switching between Rails pages and Backbone pages. From the Create Account page (a Rails page), clicking on Contact (a Backbone page) results in the url "http://localhost:3000/users/new#/contact", but it should result in "http://localhost:3000/#/contact".

- Can't alter WPM during diplay, pause, etc.

- Clicking "Speed Read It!" while text is rendering will cause a double render of both at the same time.

- No way to track user statistics.

- No About section created (maybe change Contact).
