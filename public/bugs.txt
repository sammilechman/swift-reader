List of Bugs to Fix:


- Progress bar for reading completion.

- Add pause to nav bar when paused, along with other notifications of reader.

- If paused, reset causes resume rendering.

- Settings page non existant.

- Click on "Speed Read It!", afterwords, focus is on that bar and spacebar will "click" that, not pausing correctly.

- Alter pause length based on word length?

- Stats don't update until page refresh.

- Collapse order - reader should be last.

- Clicking WPM bar WILL update the speed in box - but won't change rendering speed without pause.
